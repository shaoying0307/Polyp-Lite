# Polyp-Lite: Bridging the Efficiency–Accuracy Gap in Lightweight Polyp Detection Scenarios via Dynamic Feature Aggregation
Although colonoscopy is the cornerstone of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening, manual diagnosis remains severely constrained by high missed detection rates and limited healthcare resources. While deep learning offers a novel method for addressing these concerns, the existing models often fall into the pseudolightweight trap—reducing parameters without similarly reducing computational demands—making them ill-suited for the stringent constraints of clinical edge devices. To address this computational bottleneck, a Polyp-Lite polyp detection architecture is proposed in this study. This solution involves a heterogeneous dual-branch backbone (DualFusionNet) that integrates dynamic kernel convolution with a local-global fusion module (LGFM) to decouple spatial details from deep semantic information. Coupled with an encoder with a multifeature fusion block (MFFB) as its core feature fusion unit and a light decoder, the model further eliminates computational redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that compared with the mainstream state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, Polyp-Lite maintains high accuracy while substantially reducing computational loads, requiring only 1.6 GFLOPs. Consequently, this algorithm is an ideal choice for battery-powered, resource-constrained edge devices, establishing significant energy efficiency advantages for the clinically challenging detection of small targets. This breakthrough effectively mitigates the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency, paving the way for a lightweight pathway with high clinical translatability for allowing high-performance auxiliary diagnostics in endoscopic systems.
